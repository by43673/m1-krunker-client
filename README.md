# m1-krunker-client
adding flags to fix hitreg on idkr and LaF client. All I did was add some flags. Everything else is idkr or LaF.

You will need to use third party software to keybind shooting to fix aim freeze. No flags atm to fix aim freeze.

type 'xattr -cr /Applications/idkr.app' or 'xattr -cr /Applications/LaF.app' in terminal if you encounter something like "this app is damaged"
