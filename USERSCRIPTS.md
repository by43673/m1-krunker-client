# This is krunker client modified for native m1 mac arm. Everything is crankshaft copy except flags I added to fix hireg issues. To download, go to releases and then install the dmg from the google drive link. 
# I recommend enabling gpu rasterization for gud hitreg. Everything else is ur own preference. 
# FYI: Electron version I used: electron-nightly@12.0.0-nightly.20201116
# Use third party software such as usb overdrive to keybind to fix aim freeze. No flags atm to fix this
Here is an example on how to do it: bind left click to m5 and bind m5 to left click. In krunker, set shoot to m5(which is actually u left clicking but krunker thinks it is m5)
# Happy Krunking!
